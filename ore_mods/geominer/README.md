This is a minetest mod that adds layers of rock that gets harder and harder to mine as the player mines down. To continue mining, the player has to find dungeons that contain saplings that they use to grow trees and makes picks. After making the sticks the player has to go down and find rubies to craft a pickaxe. Once both the sticks and rubies have been found, the player can craft a pickaxe to mine the harder layers.
