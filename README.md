Tool crafting recipes are the same as *default* tool recipes and smelting lumps make bars, not ingots. But they have the same use. *adamantite* can be used to make a *chainsaw* instead of an *axe*. It has the same recipe but only deals 5 mele damage. However, it is faster because you can hold the mouse and auto attack. No repeat clicking necessary.

You can't craft blocks from the metal bars, but you can craft bricks of those metals.

Key:

    DC = default:cobble
    GO = any metal lump this mod adds (TODO: Change to 'group:ore')
    XM = xtraores:[color]marble
